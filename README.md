# CC_Reading_Prediction

Functions and scripts for our CC paper (link will be added soon). The functions contain elastic-net prediction (both 3F-CV and A-Predict-B) with inner 3F-CVs for parameter selection.

Scikit learn 0.16.1 was used to implement the elastic-net algorithm.
In this paper, python 3.4.3 was used to implement the codes.

Also, the modles construstruted using S500 dataset in our work was released to facilitate the full reproducibility of the paper.
