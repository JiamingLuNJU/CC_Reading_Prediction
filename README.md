# CC_Reading_Prediction

Functions and scripts for our CC paper (link will be added soon). The functions contain elastic-net prediction (both 3F-CV and A-Predict-B) with inner 3F-CVs for parameter selection.

In this paper, scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) 0.16.1 and python 3.4.3 were used to implement the elastic-net algorithm.

Also, the modles construstruted using S500 dataset in our work was released to facilitate the full reproducibility of the paper.
